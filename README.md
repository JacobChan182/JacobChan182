### 🧩 Featured Projects

#### HiReady.tech Continued
A corporate development tool that analyzes training videos and surfaces insights about employee understanding. It tracks viewer retention, most rewatched segments, and quiz performance, using AI for chatbots, video analysis, and content-based quizzes.  
Tech: React.js, Flask, Express.js, MongoDB, TwelveLabs, Backboard.io.

#### Flush Finder
Full‑stack web app built during a 24‑hour hackathon to help people with chronic digestive conditions find nearby public restrooms. Users can locate, rate, and plan routes based on restroom availability around them.  
Tech: React.js, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Google Maps API, Firebase, Railway.

#### MogCheck
Lightweight joke app that performs facial analysis and generates intentionally corny insults, controlled via voice commands. Built to experiment with multimodal AI and speech interfaces.  
Tech: React.js, FastAPI, Google Gemini API, React Speech Recognition.

#### Crash Course (Rhythm App)
Web-first rhythm practice app for drummers that uses a metronome and tap-to-beat scoring to improve timing. Users practice rudiments with L/R tap feedback, follow curriculum from Firestore, and get session summaries (perfect / good / miss).
Tech: React (Expo), TypeScript, Firebase Auth & Firestore, Web Audio API, React Native Web.

#### Curriculum Builder
Admin web app for the Crash Course rhythm app that lets course authors create and edit courses, lessons, and rudiments (stickings, BPM, patterns). Data is stored in the same Firestore project and is read by the rhythm app’s Learn tab; access is restricted to users with an admin role.
Tech: React.js, Vite, TypeScript, Firebase Auth & Firestore.
